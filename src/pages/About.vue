      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Halal Formosa was created as a passion project by the Muslim community
        in Taiwan. Finding halal food and prayer spaces can be challenging,
        especially for international students and travelers. Our team wanted to
        solve this by building a reliable ecosystem — starting from ingredient
        scanning, halal restaurant maps, and community-driven reporting.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Today, Halal Formosa continues to grow with the help of volunteers,
        contributors, and users who share the same mission: making halal
        discovery easier and accessible for everyone.
